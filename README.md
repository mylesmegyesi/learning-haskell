# Learning Haskell

Code I wrote while learning [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/)

## Dependencies

[The Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)

## Setup Cabal

I use sandbox mode:

```bash
$ cabal sandbox init
```

## Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
$ cabal run spec
```

## Retracing my steps:

1. I read [*Learn You A Haskell For Great Good!*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

  And did Exercises:
