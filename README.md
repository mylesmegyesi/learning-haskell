# Learning Haskell

Code I wrote while learning [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/)

## Setup

1. Install the [The Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Configure cabal. In this repository's root directory:

    `$ cabal sandbox init`

4. Run the tests to verify everything works:

    `$ cabal run spec`

## Retracing my steps:

1. I read [*Learn You A Haskell For Great Good!*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

    And did Exercises:

    * [Reverse Polish Notation Calculator](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems#reverse-polish-notation-calculator) - `LearnYouAHaskell.SolveRPN`
